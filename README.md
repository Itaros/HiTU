Guidelines

1. Post your Bug report only if you use the latest version of HiTU and use the recommended/latest Forge Version.
2. You can commit your own translations. Keep in mind that they have to be encoded in UTF8 without BOM. The en_US file is the original and is the most up-to-date file.
4. Post your feedback/suggestions here in a organized & neat way, than i will read them thoroughly and take them into consideration. I highly recommend doing it here after disccusing it on the forums.
